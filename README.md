A mutli agent system for an Anthill.

The Anthill have ants, and these ants must fetch food from sources.

Each ant will be influenced by the others. 
In fact when an ant has food, it must come back to the Anthill. On its way back, itâ€™ll drop pheromones. And the others ants will try to follow the pheromones to the source.
